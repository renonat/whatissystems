              as a Systems Design Engineering student. He saw that online digital tools could open the door

            <p>Eric developed the first commercially successful smartwatch, the Pebble Smartwatch. Before shutting down in 2016, Pebble graduated from Y Combinator and sold over a million devices. Eric describes how SYDE helped his growing entrepreneurial career: "100% help. Best undergrad engineering program for people who like to work on projects (ie design and build things). A++ would attend again. Also, the coop program at UWaterloo really helps you see what working at 'real' companies is like. My one regret is not doing more coop terms at startups."</p>
