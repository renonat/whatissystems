        <p>Choosing a University program is difficult,, especially for those with a diverse set of 
          interests. But it does not need to be a scary choice. No matter what degree you take, you 
          will be able to carve out your own niche in the world.</p>
        <p>One of the most important questions you should be asking, is whether a program will be 
          the right fit for you. This includes the academics, but also the culture and university 
          experience. While speaking to students and professors is the best resource, these 
          descriptions of life in SYDE are great accompaniments.</p>

        <p>Thereâ€™s no denying it, engineering is tough. But, the wonderful SYDE community makes our time at Waterloo worth it.
          Our professors care about us as a cohort and as individuals, and support us in our endeavours. Upper years are
          always around and easily approachable. There is a connection between cohorts, with shared events and traditions
          that bring us together over the years.</p>
        <p>
          The SYDE community is centred around the approx. 90 students who make up your cohort, many of whom you will spend 5 years
          with. They will be your support system through all 36 core courses that you take, and many of your electives. This
          means that when a tough assignment rolls through, you have friends to tackle it with. When you spend so much of
          your day with one group of people, how could you not find friends for life?</p>

        <h4 class="h4-section">Social engineering</h4>
        <p>SYDE is known as the most social engineering program here at Waterloo, and we take that role seriously. Besides spending
          so much time with our cohort, we have many chances to get to know our upper years. There are times for professional
          growth such as resume critiques and coffee chats. There are also more social traditions such as All Systems Go,
          held every term in the residence of an upper year student. Mid-term you can come out to our Coffeehouse, a great
          gathering with performances by students and professors. Add into the mix holiday celebrations, spirit weeks, and
          nights out in Uptown Waterloo, and you have a experience you will never forget!</p>

        <p>Our SYDE home is on the top floor of Engineering 5 (E5), which we share with Biomed. Here we have our primary classrooms,
          as well as all of our student spaces. You will find a student lounge accessible by all SYDE students, as well as
          a workshop and computer lab for working on design projects.</p>
