        <p>How does such a unique program such as Systems Design Engineering come to be? Over the years, the program has been
          re-modelled and shifted into many different forms, and it continues to change to this day, absorbing the influences
          of the people within it. This timelie outlines the key turning point in SyDe history. It is adapted from an Alumni's
          investigation into the matter, titled

          , which is an excellent read if you have a few minutes to spare.</p>

        <p>George Soulis, a Furniture Designer and Distinguished Mechanical Engineer, is hired to teach design classes at the
          young University of Waterloo. Soulis had never received any formal education in design; his only experience stemming
          from his time spent working in industry. Realizing the importance of formal design education, Soulis agrees to
          teach a first-year Engineering course focused on Engineering Design. There's just one problem: Soulis has no Master's
          Degree. Soulis, along with his family, is sent to Germany to complete a degree at the prestigious Hochschule für
          Gestaltung.
        </p>
        <p>Peter Roe, a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at the time, was finishing up his dissertation in systems modeling
          and analysis. However, Roe has a shows a strong interest in Engineering Design, and Dr. Kesavan, Roe's Ph.D. supervisor,
          sends Roe to Dartmoth University in the States to participate in an experimental design-teaching course.</p>

        <p>Upon Soulis' and Roe's return to Canada, the two team up with Professor Handa and create the first Engineering Design
          course at the university, known as General Engineering (GE) 11. GE 11 was a mandatory first-year course where groups
          of students were mentored by a faulty member through the process of solving an engineering design problem. At the
          end of the term, solutions would compete for a grand prize – a set of beer steins. The GENE11 course framework
          was the foundation for Systems Design's 1st year design course - SYDE161.</p>

        <p>Soulis, Roe, and Professor Johann, a Civil Engineering Professor, found the Institute of Design at the University
          of Waterloo. The purpose of the Institute is to pursue contracts in Engineering and Industrial Design, which would
          fund the development of the institute at the University. One of the first contracts for the Institute is to design
          3 of the 6 main pavilions for the 1967 International Expo, which would be help in Montréal.</p>
        <p>Soulis, Roe, and Handa curate the content of the GE 11 course into a textbook to be used for further teachings of
          the course. The book was one of the first to explicitly outline a holistic view of the engineering design process.</p>

        <p>Funding from the Institute of Design's contract work allows the group to expand. The Institute of Design is transformed
          into the Department of Design after a heated argument and a Faculty meeting, which passed the motion by a margin
          of only one vote.</p>
        <p>The Department of Design offered a diploma and masters program, as well as holding responsibilities for teaching
          design and graphics courses for the rest of the undergraduate population. Shortly after, an undergraduate and Ph.D
          program were added to round out the department's offering. In order to fill the quickly expanding department, professionals
          from all backgrounds within the university and in industry were brought in to add their expertise to the program.
          Film Makers, Civil Engineers, Architects, Mechanical Engineers, Human Factors Specialist, Electrical Engineers,
          and Photographers composed the roster of faculty setting the tone for the multidisciplinary foundation of the program.</p>

        <h1 class="h1-section">1968</h1>
        <p>In the wake of major restructuring of the University's faculties and programs, the Systems Design Engineering program
          separated from the rest of the Department of Design to stand as it's own Engineering Program. The program consisted
          of three years of general study, one year of specialization, and one year of deep study. Systems Design Engineering
          students had access to a great range of specializations in addition to the course engineering programs offered
          by the university, reflected the unique background and capabilities of the faculty staff.</p>

        <p>The Department of Systems Design Engineering is ready to accept it's first official class. True to being unique,
          the faculty decides to hire a co-op student to travel across Ontario via motorbike, promoting the new program to
          advent-seeking and risk-taking high school students. In September of 1969, 60 student show up to take on the challenge.</p>

        <p>Jump forward, and the Department of Systems Design Engineering still offers it's original degree programs, in addition
          to a new Biomedical Engineering program. The collective academic background of the faculty has grown and evolved
          with the influence of the department's leadership and the rapid advancements of technology. However, the founding
          principle of Systems Design Engineering,
          <b>'...to produce leaders of technology'</b>, remains unchanged and holds true to this day.</p>
