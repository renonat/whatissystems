        <p>People have trouble describing SYDE because it does not fit into a stereotype of what engineering work should be.
          But, this does not discredit the work that we do. While Systems Design may appear very broad, it is NOT a general
          engineering program that you might find at other Universities. We learn the specific skills of design and systems
          thinking. One than can apply these skills to their field of interest.</p>
        <p>There is a trade-off that comes with being a SYDE student: deeply specializing in another field may need extracurricular
          work. For example, you will need to put in extra time to practice and learn to be as specialized as a mechanical
          engineer. Thus if you are highly passionate about a single field, consider directly pursuing that field. As a SYDE
          student, you must be proactive to find your niche. But, the knowledge you gain from SYDE will give you great freedom
          within your career.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-section">Can I specialize?</h2>
        <p>While you can specialize through co-op terms and side projects, you can also take specialized electives. These electives
          allow you to become an expert at what YOU choose to focus on. There will be a great deal of freedom to learn in
          your field of choice, but it does need some thinking about disciplines beforehand. The goal of the program is to produce 
          engineers who are "jacks of all trades but master of one." Give consideration to your elective choices, as they form 
          the skillset that you take to the workforce as a practicing engineer.</p>
        <p>If you do not know where your passions lie for your career, that is okay. Many spend their first two years exploring
          different fields through co-op positions. By midway through your degree, you should have an idea of your career
          goals and spend your time honing your skills. While it is okay to explore a variety of fields, be aware that it
          may impact the ease of finding co-op positions. </p>

        <p>While you can choose technical electives at your discretion, the department and faculty have made packages of electives
          that you can choose from to focus your studies.</p>
