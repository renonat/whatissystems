        <p>Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) has a focus on systems thinking and design thinking. Systems thinking, along with
          mathematical skills, is used to model complex physical problems. Design thinking is applied to create human-centered
          solutions to these problems. We tackle interdisciplinary problems that cover many areas of engineering, including
          software, hardware, mechanical, and industrial.</p>
        <p>SYDE is an accredited engineering program, meaning its graduates are eligible for the
          <a href="http://www.peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=1847&la_id=1">Professional Engineering designation through PEO</a>. As such we learn a lot of theory in math and physics, as
          well as applications in hardware and software. The first two years are about understanding the physical world,
          and acquiring analytic and math skills. This toolbox of skills allows us to solve real, hands-on problems involving
          large systems.</p>
        <p>Design is a complementary skill set of processes for planning and executing solutions to problems. The perfect complement
          to engineering, design is rarely taught outright to engineers. Human-centered design processes allow an engineer
          to think beyond the technical aspects of a problem. Design ensures that an engineer's solution "fits human desires,
          needs, and capabilities. After all, why do we make products? We make them for people to use." We practice our design
          skills every term through project courses.</p>
        <p>The skills that we learn in SYDE can be applied to any problem in any field. Our core courses teach us a diverse
          mix of applied and technical skills, broken down by field below. Students also have access to a wide array of technical
          electives, and can
          <a href="/general-engineering">specialize</a> in nearly any other field of engineering.

        <p>What sets Systems apart from your typical engineering program is our emphasis on designing for all people. Design
          is more than making things aesthetically pleasing; it is a method to design useable solutions. Human Centered Design
          means questioning the problem that you think you need to solve. It involves deeply understanding the people who
          will use your engineered solution. Design is all about starting with people, instead of starting technical. This
          process is an effective way to solve engineering problems, as well as the human concerns that accompany them.</p>

        <p>Engineering problems are complicated, and they will only grow in complexity as society progresses. Take something
          as seemingly simple as an iPhone. Look inside and you will find:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A battery worked on by chemical engineers.</li>
          <li>Circuit boards worked on by computer engineers.</li>
          <li>A radio/cell system worked on by electrical engineers.</li>
          <li>A screen with programs worked on by software engineers.</li>
          <li>A manufacturing process worked on by industrial engineers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These small parts connected together as an iPhone create an impact on society greater than they could on their own.
          This is a system, and one that a Systems Design Engineer may work on.</p>

        <h4 class="h4-section">Systems thinking</h4>
        <p>Systems are an organized assembly of interconnected components. The interactions of components create behaviours
          that affect the system as a whole. This definition is general on purpose; systems can be anything. The process
          you learn for analyzing the drive-train of a car can be applied to analyzing the resilience of an entire city.
          Systems thinking is a method for designing and managing these diverse systems. In essence it is a unique way of
          viewing problems.</p>

        <h4 class="h4-section">Modelling the world</h4>
        <p>As engineers, use systems thinking to create models of physical systems so as to understand engineering problems.
          This is why we take so many physics and math courses, so that we can apply our skills to modelling dynamic systems.
          Such problems may be as simple as a slinky that continues bouncing even after you drop it down a staircase. This
          also applies to complex problems involving many moving parts, stresses, and applied forces.</p>
