# What Is Systems?
A student website (in development) dedicated to describing life in Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) at the University of Waterloo.

While the University accepted its first students into SYDE back in 1969, to this day it is misunderstood by the wider population. Even our own Dean of Engineering was quoted saying "I don't know what systems design engineering is". This website serves as a guidebook written by SYDE students who adore their program, for future students contemplating a career in engineering.

The current in-development version of the website can be found at https://what-is-systems.firebaseapp.com/
