# What Is Systems? (Homepage)

```
Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo
```

The homepage will be the initial point of contact with the user, and thus as such should recognize the purpose of visiting this website, and provide them with a concise summary of SYDE.

```
S Y D E, What is Systems? Just ask me!
```

The first blurb should be a statement about who the site is for, and what questions it sets out to answer:

```
Whether you are potential student, a curious employer, or anyone in between, join us on our Systems Design Engineering journey to learn:
What is Systems Design?
Will this program be the right fit for me?
Where do students apply their skills?
```

## What is Systems Design Engineering?

### What do we learn?

First blurb should talk generally, taking a route similar to the official descriptions on the website and in brochures.

```
As a discipline, Systems Design Engineering uses systems theory as the mathematical basis for analyzing and modelling the world, and design thinking as the insight needed to to solve problems while keeping the users in focus. The engineering problems that we tackle are commonly interdisciplinary, and require strong decision making and leadership skills.

Why do these concepts matter? They allow us to work in fields such as software development, hardware, project/product management, human factors analysis, and user interface/experience design. Those with specialized interests have taken their skills into quantitative finance, medical device development, and civil and mechatronics engineering, to name just a few.
```

Second blurb should talk about the math/systems side of things (Link to Systems page).

```

```

Third blurb should talk more about design and real-world applications of our skills (Link to design page).



```

```

Final blurb should talk about the skills that we learn, and connected courses. I am thinking a chart relating skills to courses, and the courses can be clicked on for a short description of the course. Additionally mention the flexibility in electives, and link to the page on specialization.

#### Design?

1: Talk about what design is in this context (not visual design, but design thinking)

- Embed a YouTube video that nicely covers human centered design
- IDEO: What is Human Centered Design? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=musmgKEPY2o

2: Talk about proven methods and their sources (Design Sprints, Human Factors Analysis)

3: Examples of where design thinking can be found in real work (link to projects, )

4: Want to learn more? Examples of relevant websites, books, etc

- IDEO Design Kit - http://www.designkit.org/
- Happy City (book) - thorough application of design thinking in city design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiQUzOnA5w (TedTalk)
- Why Design Should Include Everyone (TedTalk) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD_SLJG7oi8
- Sprint (Book) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU4c5_xKxS8
- Thinking Fast and Slow (Book)

What sets Systems apart from your typical engineering program is our empahsis on designing for everything, and everyone. Design is so much more than making things asthetically pleasing. Design is a methodology to find and solve problems. Not only do we study and create software, but learn how to do so for people. We don't stop at building bridges, but understand who will be using them and what their needs are. In short, the design proccess is a holistic and effective approach to solving technical issues while addressing human-centered ones that inevitably accompany them. 

“Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.” —Tim Brown, President and CEO of IDEO

“Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.” 
― Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

#### Systems?

1: Why we take so many math and physics courses -> systems modelling

2: The elephant parable story

3: about integrating all our knowledge together and dealing with ambiguity

4: outline the base tenants of systems thinking,
