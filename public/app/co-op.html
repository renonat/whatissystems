        <p>Waterloo’s co-op program is absolutely fantastic. Why? You get experience in the fields that you are interested in,
          not only to gain contacts for your future career, but also to discover what you like (and don’t like) to do. Your
          six co-op positions are paid, and will also help you fund an education that grows more costly every year.</p>

            <p>Waterloo has different academic/co-op term patterns, with SYDE being solely 4-Stream. This mean students start
              their first work term after 4-months of school. This means getting job experience sooner, and ending your degree
              off with 2 consecutive academic terms.</p>
            <blockquote class="future">
              <b>For future students:</b> While the idea of working so soon may be scary, it does have some advantages. You
              will have less competition for jobs in the winter, and will start earning money sooner than your peers in 8-stream!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="h3-section">What are applications like?</h3>
        <p>When you first start 1A, you will have a few weeks to prepare your resume (start in the summer, and get upper years
          to review it). Then, you will have a week long job application period, where you can browse the job postings on
          Waterloo Works and submit your application. The number of job postings number in the thousands, but don’t be too
          picky at first because a job is not guaranteed.</p>
        <p>After applications, employers will slowly send out interview bookings, during which time you can choose an interview
          timeslot. Most interviews are held in person, on campus, which is very convenient for students. After interviews,
          both students and employers will submit job rankings, and then students are matched (hopefully) with their jobs
          for the next term. If you don’t get matched, you have the opportunity to keep applying so don’t ever lose hope.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-section">How much do students earn?</h3>
        <p>Your first stop for checking average earnings should be the
          <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/why-co-op/co-op-earnings/hourly-earnings-information-january-december-2016">
            official CECA webpage</a>. Since employers are subsidized by the government, wages are quite reasonable. Be warned
          though, wages on the CECA page are skewed downward as they exclude most USA-based jobs which tend to have higher
          pay and include food/housing. A fair number of employers base their wages on this data, so it is still a good representation.
          For information specific to SYDE, see the following data pulled from the Class of 2017 survey, but keep in mind
          changes in inflation in the years since date of publish.</p>
        <section>
          <div id="chart-hourly-salary"></div>
          <footer class="media-footer">Salary distribution became bimodal in later terms, mostly due to US jobs. Average salary in 1A was $16.8/hr CAD.
            By 3B, average salary grew to $25.4/hr CAD for Canadian jobs and $49.4/hr CAD for US jobs (exchange rates differ
            by term, as shown).
            <br> This difference is in part due to the exchange rate and high demand for software engineers in the US. The salary
            gap is actually understated here, as housing stipends is excluded (which is more common for US jobs). This would
            add ~$10/hr CAD to the average salary for US jobs.</footer>

        <h3 class="h3-section">Can I pay for my education?</h3>
        <p>While there is no guarantee that co-op can pay for your entire education, it certainly can take a load off of students
          who would have had to take out large loans to pay for their education. Of the Class of 2017, almost half the class
          graduated with no student debt, and the mean amount of debt was less than $10,000.</p>
        <div id="chart-student-debt"></div>
        <footer class="media-footer">47% of students graduated with no student debt.
          <br>The mean amount of debt was $9,454.
