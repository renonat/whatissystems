    <p>Thereâ€™s no denying it, engineering is tough. But, the wonderful SYDE community makes our time at Waterloo worth
      it. Our professors care about us as a cohort and as individuals, and support us in our endeavours. Upper years
      are always around and easily approachable. There is a connection between cohorts, with shared events and
      traditions that bring us together over the years.</p>
    <p>
      The SYDE community is centred around the approx. 90 students who make up your cohort, many of whom you will spend
      5 years with. They will be your support system through all 36 core courses that you take, and many of your
      electives. This means that when a tough assignment rolls through, you have friends to tackle it with. When you
      spend so much of your day with one group of people, how could you not find friends for life?</p>

    <h3 class="h3-section">Social engineering</h3>
    <p>SYDE is known as the most social engineering program here at Waterloo, and we take that role seriously. Besides
      spending so much time with our cohort, we have many chances to get to know our upper years. There are times
      for professional growth such as resume critiques and coffee chats. There are also more social traditions such
      as All Systems Go, held every term in the residence of an upper year student. Mid-term you can come out to our
      Coffeehouse, a great gathering with performances by students and professors. Add into the mix holiday
      celebrations, spirit weeks, and nights out in Uptown Waterloo, and you have a experience you will never forget!</p>

    <p>Our SYDE home is on the top floor of Engineering 5 (E5), which we share with Biomed. Here we have our
      primary classrooms, as well as all of our student spaces. You will find a student lounge accessible by
      all SYDE students, as well as a workshop and computer lab for working on design projects.</p>
